## Hi there 👋

I am Collie Kim.

### About me

- Founder with a multifaceted background: writer, community leader, photographer, product designer, video creator, and developer.
- Studied development at 42 Seoul (École 42's peer-learning program). Took a detour into photography, now building again in the AI-native era.
- Shipping products with Claude Code. Growing products the way Koreans do best: through engaging video content and viral marketing on YouTube. ([channel link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYiwCI5i7N1lmtuqHxf39QA))
- Newly fascinated by data analytics and Palantir's methodology. Preparing projects that thread data-driven solutions into seamless workflows.
